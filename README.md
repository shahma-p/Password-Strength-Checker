# Password Strength Checker

This project is a password input field that dynamically displays the strength of the entered password. As users type into the password field, the strength is evaluated, and the border color of the input box changes to reflect the strength (weak, medium, or strong).

## Features

- **Dynamic Border Color**: The border color of the password field changes according to the password strength.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Users get instant feedback on the strength of their password as they type.
